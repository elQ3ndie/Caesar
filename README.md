# Caesar Cipher Web Application

This is a simple web application that performs Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption on text input. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Allows the user to specify the encryption/decryption key.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters in the text.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and script for the web application.
- `css/main.css`: The CSS file for styling the web application (assumed to be included in the project).

## Usage

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of:

1. A `textarea` for inputting the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
2. An `input` field for specifying the key (number of positions to shift).
3. Two buttons, one for encrypting the text and the other for decrypting it.
